90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: AQ; Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Automatic tagging was based on the table of content
    created by the editor, so I had to remove many arbitrary headings Apart
    from that the editor has added headings within [] to the chapter
    headings (bƒÅbs), those are kept. The URI should be changed as I have
    suggested already to "0415QadiCabdJabbar"
    Gowaart: deleted editorial sections, footnote markers and forward slashes which
    were still present. URI has been changed already. I also deleted the volume
    headers, as these are clearly editorial, the text is not meaningfully divided
    into volumes. I tagged the poetry where I could find it easily (either there
    isn't much poetry in the text, or the majority hadn't been formatted as poetry).
    Pagination seems correct.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
