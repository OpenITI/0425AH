90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- Many titles are missing. I put blank headers in
    their places (but I didn’t add the titles because I’m not allowed to add
    anything to the text). 2- A different edition of the text that is
    accessible on the internet can be found here: https://download-library-
    pdf-ebooks.com/20951-free-book
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
