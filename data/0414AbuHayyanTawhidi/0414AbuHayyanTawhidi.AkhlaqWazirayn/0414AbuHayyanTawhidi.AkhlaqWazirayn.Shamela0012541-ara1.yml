90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text of page 531 was missing, and one line of
    poetry on p. 407;  PV added both. All other pages seem present. Some
    page numbers were missing, but the text seems complete  (Missing page
    numbers are the same pages of which the images are missing in the pdf
    https://archive.org/details/khatabaya2007_yahoo_20171022 (pp. 1, 4-5,
    8-9)) The edition does not contain explicit subdivisions;  PV has added
    (between square brackets) the subdivisions mentioned by Behzadi (Lale
    Behzadi, "Authorial Guidance: Abū Ḥayyān al-Tawḥīdī's Closing Remarks",
    in: Lale Behzadi, Haakkoo Hämeen-Anttila (eds.),  Concepts of Authorship
    in Premodern Arabic Texts, Bamberg 2015, pp. 216, 220;  https://www.uni-
    bamberg.de/fileadmin/arabistik/Behzadi_Artikel.pdf). Occasionally,
    individual hemistichs were not separated by %~%  (see the poems on pp.
    222, 373, 398, 428, 430, 523, 524).  The reason is that, in such cases,
    the boundary between the two hemistichs corresponds to a consonant with
    tashdīd  (such as yaladh %~% dhu, yuḥak %~% kimu, him %~% mati, etc.),
    which cannot be split. In such cases, %~% has been inserted as -%~%-
    according to the respective metre, with one of the doubled consonants on
    each side of -%~%- (e.g., yaladh -%~%- dhu, yuḥak -%~%- kimu, etc.); on
    p. 524, %~% has been added by the annotator according to the metre.
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 96, 1610, 1611,
    1612, 1613, 1614, 1615, 1951, 1953, 2241, 2744, 4955, 4959, 5572, 5601, 5602,
    5603, 5604, 5605, 5606
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too long: line numbers 1115, 1119
