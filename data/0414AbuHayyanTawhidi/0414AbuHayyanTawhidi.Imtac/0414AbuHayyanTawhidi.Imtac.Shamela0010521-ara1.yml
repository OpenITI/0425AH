90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Deleted editorial sections and footnotes, tagged poetry. The
    text is divided into three parts which appears to be inherited from the original
    text (every volume has a separate introduction), so I have left the division in
    place. The edition used here is the one circulating most widely online, seems to
    be a reprint of the Amin & Zayn edition.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): The editorial section in PageV01P159 removed. The
    header in PageV01P404 turned from third-level into second-level.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
