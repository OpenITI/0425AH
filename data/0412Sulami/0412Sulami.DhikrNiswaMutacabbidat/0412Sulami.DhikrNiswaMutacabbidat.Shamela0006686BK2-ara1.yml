90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text was tagged before; from notes > PDF was
    matched to this version; Some numbers were missing.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): PARATEXT added. Women’s entries tagged.
    2- The second part which is for women’s biographies seems to be a separate
    text. I raised an issue for it.
    PV: the original text file contained two separate texts:
    * 0412Sulami.DhikrNiswaMutacabbidat
    * 0412Sulami.TabaqatSufiyya.Shamela0006686-ara1
    PV split them off into separate text files
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
    Link to the text file as it was before it was cleaned:
